# Module_4_Challenge
## Summary of Project
### This analysis provides summary statistics of primarily reading and math scores as well as the budgets of various high schools. It provides the mean and min reading and math scores and also provides the blueprint to drill down to specific schools and grades within each school. It also provides the ability to compare public and charter schools. Public schools have larger budgets, but Charter schools have slightly better reading and math scores. In a future analysis it would be interesting to compare the average size of Charter and Public schools and breakdown the budget per student. This analysis does provide the number of students within each school.
